Welcome to my programing class portfolio, my name is Shirley.

For the past semester, I have been completing some programing assignments to the best of my ability.

I do not have a passion for this anymore.

Here I have a few projects that I am moderately glad to have worked on through the semester.

Project 1: Midterm Moth's Den Game
This was a C# coded game with a .NETcore framework I worked on with my game idea of a local investigator trying to figure out the cause
 mysterious disaperances in their town. 
[Moths Den Midterm Project (1).zip](https://github.com/popiicuu/popiicuu.github.io/files/15218099/Moths.Den.Midterm.Project.1.zip)
I Used a lot of lists and string variables to gather options for players to chose from for dialouge and also tried to implement scene changes

Project 2: Trivia Game
[Trying the Trivia Game Again - Copy (2).zip](https://github.com/popiicuu/popiicuu.github.io/files/15218122/Trying.the.Trivia.Game.Again.-.Copy.2.zip)
This was a trivia game project where we had to make a short but creative set of questions for the player to answer and try to get right.
For this project, I had to create lists and make sure that they would relay back properly to the correct answer and also be able to keep track of a point system.
I had to use soem help that is credited inside the code file but it pushed me to learn how to keep track and clean up code.

Project 3: Store application
[Store Application.zip](https://github.com/popiicuu/popiicuu.github.io/files/15218246/Store.Application.zip)
This is a simple online store appilcation of adding, browising, and paying for items within a shop. I just based my items off Hannibal but this format of code was much helpful in understanding lists and arrays functions. It also registered a set list and calucations of prices and quanities.

Project 4:Adopt An Insect
[AdoptInsect - Copy.zip](https://github.com/popiicuu/popiicuu.github.io/files/15218247/AdoptInsect.-.Copy.zip)
I can't remember much of the cpde involved in this as it was my first project. It was a project just to establish a simple system of adopting one insect, naming it, and having it registered as the player's insect. It wasn't much but it taught me a lot of console.write, list set ups, and console write lines with established functiosn like {player.Name}
