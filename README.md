Welcome to my programing class portfolio, my name is Shirley.

For the past semester, I have been completing some programing assignments to the best of my ability.

I do not have a passion for this anymore.

Here I have a few projects that I am moderately glad to have worked on through the semester.

Project 1: Midterm Moth's Den Game
This was a C# coded game with a .NETcore framework I worked on with my game idea of a local investigator trying to figure out the cause
 mysterious disaperances in their town. 

 It was pretty complex and had a rang of issesswwssssssdsdc
